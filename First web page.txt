<h1> Nevaeh Avilez </h1>
<h2> Introduction </h2>
<p> I am from Ennis, Montana and I am currently in my last semester of my business degree. I am currently starting my own leatherworking business. Outside of school and work, I love to rock climb, play board games, and hang out with my family. </p>
<h2> My pets </h2>
<p> I love my dog. Her name is Tate and she is a corgi, mini aussie mix. She is sassy and loves to go rock climbing and to cow camp with me. </p>
