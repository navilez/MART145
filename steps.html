		<h2>Step 1</h2>
		<p>The first step is creating a template for whatever design you would like on the leather. Coming up with a plan is important in leather design.</p>

		<h2>Step 2</h2>
		<p>Cut out the shape of leather needed for your item</p>
	
		<h2>Step 3</h2>
		<p>Wet the leather and transfer the design onto the piece of leather. Grab the swivel knife and carve into the design.</p>
	
		<h2>Step 4</h2>
		<p>Using various tools, bevel and add finishing touches to the design. To bevel, use a beveling tool and a maul to press the wet leather into the design.</p>
	
		<h2>Step 5</h2>
		<p>Let the leather dry and make sure it is conditioned before adding stain and antique</p>
	
		<h2>Step 6</h2>
		<p>Once the stain is dry, sew and add buttons or screws if needed. This is the step to assemble.</p>
	
		<h2>Step 7</h2>
		<p>Add finishing glosses or sealants for the leather to lock in the stain and allow for a cleaner presentation</p>
