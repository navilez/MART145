		<h2> Introduction </h2>
		<p> Custom leatherwork can be a hobby or a business. For me, it started off as a hobby but eventually turned into a business. It is an art - crafting unique pieces while capturing functionality, durability, and personal expression. There are many techniques used to create leather goods- all of which contribute to an artists personal style and product quality. Unlike mass-produced goods, custom leatherwork allows for personalization to make each item meaningful and tailored to the needs of each individual.  </p>
