		<h1> Nevaeh Avilez </h1>
		
		<h2> Introduction </h2>
		<p> I am from Ennis, Montana and I am currently in my last semester of my business degree. The reason I sought to pursue my business degree is because I always had a goal to start my own leatherworking business. Outside of school and work, I love to rock climb, play board games, and hang out with my family. </p>

		<h2> My pets </h2>
		<p> I love my dog. Her name is Tate and she is a corgi, mini aussie mix. She is sassy and loves to go rock climbing and to cow camp with me. </p>
		
		<h2> Background </h2>
		<p> Growing up, I always had a passion for agriculture, and it has only grown. I grew up with chickens, horses, cows, and pigs. Then in high school, I competed in FFA. Now, agriculture is in my heart and I sought a minor in farm and ranch management for my degree. </p>
