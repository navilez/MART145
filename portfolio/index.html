        <h1>Beginner Website Project Reflection</h1>

        <p>
            Creating my 5-page website was a really enjoyable experience. I had a lot of fun with the project because it allowed me 
            to express my love for leatherwork while also sharing some of the knowledge I've gained about it. Building the site from 
            scratch helped me understand the basics of web design, and it was rewarding to see something I'm passionate about come 
            to life on a webpage.
        </p>

        <p>
            Working on the Bootstrap webpage was also a unique and exciting part of this project. It was interesting to take an 
            existing template and transform it into something that felt like my own. Even though the structure was already built, 
            customizing the layout and styling helped it look polished and professional. It showed me how powerful Bootstrap can be 
            for quickly creating clean, modern designs.
        </p>

        <p>
            Overall, this project gave me confidence as a beginner in web development and provided a solid foundation for future 
            websites I create.
